### Homework 2
In this repository there is the material about the Homework 2 of Algorithmic methods of data mining. \
The **main.ipynb** is a Jupyter notebook that contains the answers at the 7 questions about the [datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/mkechinov/ecommerce-behavior-data-from-multi-category-store?select=2019-Oct.csv) of the e-commerce. \
In specific, the datasets analyzed are from the month of October 2019 to the month of April 2020. But due to RAM problem only the two mandatory datasets, October 2019 and November 2019, are been entirely analyze because otherwise I would have had some overhead issues. \
In order to reduce pandas memory usage I load only 1000000 rows of the non-mandatory datasets, from December to April, as we did in a laboratory lesson. \
So, even if the procedures are explained for each question, the comments about the obtained results are made only on the datasets of October and November, because the results of the other datasets aren't trustworthy as there are some missing information. \
The second file is a .py file named **functions** that contains all the functions created in order to answer to the questions.
